# Addepar Bootstrap

## Important!

You are about to view a modified version of bootstrap.  **Do not make any changes to this repository!** Any changes you make will be lost if bootstrap is updated. If a change is unavoidable, leave a very detailed comment describing and justifying your edits in the README file.

We have created this version of bootstrap to eliminate `print.less`, which sets print styles like page background color and text color and makes them difficult to change or restore.
